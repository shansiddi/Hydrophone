Problem Statements<br/>

Part 1 Wind and Rain Noise<br/>
7. In each site and for each category that you identified in step 3, plot 𝑃𝑆𝐷𝑑𝐵 vs frequency<br/>
8.Compare the spectral levels and answer these questions:<br/>
a) What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.<br/>
b) Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind?<br/>
c) What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore?<br/>
Part 2 Airgun, Marine Mammals, Earthquake/Volcano Noise<br/>
1. Find a short time period that there is a marine mammal vocalization in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.<br/>
2. Find a short time period that there is an airgun noise in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.<br/>
3. Find a short time period that there is an earthquake or a volcano eruption in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.<br/>
4. Compare the bandwidth of these three signals. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve?<br/>
